## Creating Blog Categories

Creating blog categories is very simple. Just create sub-notes under the "Article categories" note, and then assign the following attributes to that note:

*   `#categoryName = xxx` - This attribute is used by the "blogStateChange" script to find the corresponding category. It is recommended to keep it consistent with the category title.
*   `#sorted=date #sortDirection=desc` - (Optional but recommended) Sort blog posts by publication date in descending order.

## Publishing a Blog Post

You can write your blog post anywhere in your note repository. The only thing you need to do before writing a new blog post is to select the "Blog Post Template".

Here's how to create a new blog post:

1. Right-click on any parent note where you want to store your blog post (e.g., Today's Diary).
2. Move your mouse over "Insert child note".
3. Select "Blog Post Template".

A blog post has four basic attributes:

*   **Category** - The category to which the blog post belongs. It should match the value of `#categoryName` for the corresponding category.
*   **Tags** - Tags for the blog post. Multiple tags can be added.
*   **Header Image** - The preview image displayed on the homepage for the blog post. You need to provide a URL or image hosting link.
*   **Time** - The publication time of the blog post.

Publishing a blog post is simple. Just click the "Publish" button, and it will be published automatically. If you want to unpublish a blog post, simply uncheck the "Publish" option.

## How to Pin a Blog Post

To pin a blog post, add the following attribute to the desired blog post. This will make it appear at the top of the "Timeline" and its corresponding category.

*   `#blogPostTop`
